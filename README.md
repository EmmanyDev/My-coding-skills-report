# My-coding-skills-report

I had started learning how to code in the Summer of 2017, on Khanacademy, and I was learning p5.js. I've never had so much fun creating and programming shapes, figures, animations, and then watching them go when the program ran. This moment would change my life forever.

I just had to learn more because I wanted to see what else I could do with coding knowledge. In the Fall of 2017, I learned HTML and CSS through Codecademy, and I used the SoloLearn app to refine my skills. For the rest of my high school years, I've created projects, designed my own websites, worked on passion projects, and would just spend hours and hours coding with HTML and CSS, without using templates! I just loved to create then.

After a year, in 2018, I decided to create my own coding report where I would put the languages that I know on it, my experience from it, and a program bar to measure my knowledge and experience (estimated of course). Knowing I was going to learn a lot more, I made sure to come back to it and update the page with a new language that I've learned. I've also put the three resources I've used to get this far in my coding journey. And as a bonus, I have my signature on the page :D

As of now, I'm a rising junior computer science major with a cybersecurity concentration, and in addition to what I knew prior to college, I now know and Have worked with JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Java, and SQL. Insane right?!

Anyways, here's my report. I hope you enjoy it, and happy coding!
